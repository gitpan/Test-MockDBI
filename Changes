Revision history for Perl extension Test::MockDBI.

0.60  Thu Jan 27 17:18:47 EST 2005
    - Added DBI::do() and DBI::rows().
    - DBI::bind_columns() now works, rather than only
      pretending to work.
    - DBI::fetchrow() was corrected to return an array.
      This function is so old, it is no longer documented
      in the main DBI docs.
    - The list-returning DBI fetch*() functions now
      return an empty list when set_retval_array() gives
      them an empty list or no list.
    - A list consisting of 1 undef element is now
      returned as such by the list-returning DBI
      fetch*() methods.
    - README now talks a little about the testing
      configuration file, DBI.cfg.
    - NOTE: The Perl Cookbook, 2nd Edition, recipe 10.10
      has a good explanation of list/array return values :).
