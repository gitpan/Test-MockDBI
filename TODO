- Move database-handle-specific data to the mock DBI 
  database handle object, so that different database
  handles can have different Test::MockDBI configurations.
  This will probably involve changing the Test::MockDBI API
  to include the database handle as an argument.   Also, the
  DBI functions that return a statement handle will need to
  be modified to return the correct mock DBI database handle.

- Add code so the output of Test::MockDBI can go to different
  places rather than just standard output.  This would allow
  use of Test::MockDBI in environments where examining
  standard output is impractical at best, like Apache modules.
  IO::String would help in redirecting output to strings.

- Diverting output could either create a trace of DBI methods
  called with their arguments, or just keep around the most
  current DBI method execution data.  Probably both types of
  diversions should be supported.

- Add the magic anti-shell incantation to force Perl to run
  the separate test programs right after the #! line.

- Increase the number of DBI methods mocked up.

- Figure out how DBI::quote() should work when mocked-up.

- Could Test::MockDBI and DBD::Mock work together?  Does this
  even make any sense?
